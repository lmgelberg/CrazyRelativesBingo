<p align="left">You know, there is no such thing as a 
&quot;functional family&quot;.&nbsp; All families are screwed up.&nbsp; Some in big ways, 
some in small, but be assured that it's not just your family that has skeletons 
in the closet and black sheep that no one talks about.&nbsp; All families are 
screwed up.&nbsp; </p>
<p align="left">So you might as well have some fun with it!</p>
<p align="left">Welcome to &quot;<b>Crazy Relatives Bingo!</b>&quot; - 
zthe game that can turn every tedious reunion, get-together, wedding, Bar 
Mitzvah, whatever into hours of wicked fun! All you need to do is print out a new page for each player. Check off boxes as you see bad behavior - 5 in a row wins! </p>

<p align="left"><b>Rules:</b></p>
<ol>
	<li>
	<p align="left">Each player prints out a unique card.&nbsp; 
	Each time you witness some atrocious behavior that matches a square entry, 
	cross that square out.&nbsp; The first player to get five squares in a row 
	(horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) cries out &quot;BINGO!&quot; and is declared 
	the winner!&nbsp; Nothing could be easier, right?</li>
<li>
	If you get a <b>Bonus</b> square, you may take an additional square as well!
</li>	
<li>
	<p align="left">Our pronouns are generic.&nbsp; When we 
	say &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; it doesn't have to be a literal &quot;Uncle Bob&quot; - it could be 
	&quot;Cousin Joe&quot;, &quot;Dad&quot;, or even lovable old &quot;Grampie&quot;.</li>
	<li>
	<p align="left">This is honor-system based, but 
	if you are able to collect photographic evidence, you can use that as a <b>BONUS</b> square and 
	take any extra square of your choice!</li>
